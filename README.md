## Introduction
Machine learning is a critical component in the realm of artificial intelligence, empowering systems to learn from data. This repository serves as a comprehensive reference for a range of ML algorithms with focus on:

- **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms that learn from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms that discover hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

Each folder contains:
1. Algorithm description
2. Code implementation in Python
3. Mathematical analysis (cost functions, gradients, etc.)
4. Sample datasets and results

## Supervised Learning Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Naive Bayes
- Neural Networks

## Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
- k-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Autoencoders

## Installation
To use the algorithms in this repository, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Each algorithm has its own folder. To run an algorithm, navigate to its folder and execute the corresponding Python script. For example:

```bash
cd Supervised/LinearRegression
python linear_regression.py
```

## Mathematical Analysis
In each algorithm's folder, a `README.md` file explains the mathematical foundation:
- **Cost functions** and their derivatives
- **Gradient descent** for optimization
- **Error metrics** such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Accuracy, and others.

Mathematical details and proofs are provided for a deeper understanding of each algorithm.
